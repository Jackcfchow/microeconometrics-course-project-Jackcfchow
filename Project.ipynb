    "Beakley and Chin (2010) discuss the effect of English proficiency on social assimilation among immigrants in the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is intuitive that immigrants with better English skills would be melt in the US society more thoroughly, competitive theories can be offered to explain the correlation between the two properties. A theory is that English skill lowers the difficulty, or, as economists put it, the cost of across group social interactions. As a result, interaction with the local increases when the immigrants have better English skills. On the other hand, it can also be argued that it is the people, who prefer the destination country’s culture and society more, self-selected into immigrating into the US. And the higher English level of this group of people is another product of their endorsement towards the US culture. So the correlation is just driven by the cultural preference as a confounding factor, rather than causation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Beakley and Chin (2010) shows evidential support for the theory that English proficiency causes social integrations and 2000 census data. The empirical strategy employed is to use the age of arrival as an instrumental variable. The justification of this practice is that the age of arrival correlates with the ability to acquire a second language and at the same time, does not affect other endogenous variables. Researchers also exploited immigrants from Anglophone countries as a control group for non-linguistic effects of age at arrival.\n",
    "\n",
    "(In this notebook, we will replicate this study of Beakley and Chin. After that, a discussion of the conceptual framework and robustness checks will be offered. My analysis explores some conceptual and econometric issues in the original study.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is structured as follows. In the next section, I present the theoretical framework under which the econometric models are formulated. In Section 3, we analyze the instrumental variable strategy employed and the specification of the estimations. The main highlights of this notebook are sections 5 to 7. In Section 5 we investigate some conceptual problems hidden in the benchmark. Section 6 presents our replication of the results in the benchmark. In Section 7we show various robustness checks complemented with a discussion concerning the limitations of the prior research. Section 8 is the conclusion.\n"

    "# 2. Theoretical Background\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers are motivated to study the factors contributing to the social assimilation of immigrants. The relationship between the proficiency of the dominant language in the destination country and the level of social assimilation brings significant policy implications. If knowing the mainstream language helps immigrants integrating into their new home, then policies help improving language skills can certainly enhance social harmony.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But the nature of that correlation is still debatable. The “casual hypothesis” claims that language proficiency lower the effort, or in an economics terminology - the “cost” of social interaction with the local residents. Under this partial equilibrium framework, lowering the cost of social interaction implies an increase in the consumption of it. Therefore the language proficiency causes social interaction. However, this hypothesis comes across challenges. The first one is that language proficiency is correlated with other variables that will affect the social outcome. For example, how well a person masters a second language is correlated with his ability such as IQ. It is possible that an immigrant is getting a well-paid simply because of his higher ability instead of language proficiency. Secondly, even if there is a direct relationship between language proficiency and social outcome, it still remains doubtful if it is the people have assimilated into the destination country, such as by having a spouse or a job in the destination country, can improve the English proficiency during their stay in the destination country. These challenges can be expressed in a causal graph G1.\n",

    "#3. Data Description \n",
    "Our data is obtained from the 2000 US Census of Population and Housing. Measures including English level, a crucial variable for our computation of the instrumental variable, are self-reported by the respondent as a categorical variable. The census was conducted on household level. We can identify each respondent’s and the cohabiting spouse’s answer. Martial outcomes in social assimilation are therefore possible to be shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "We subset the data to childhood immigrants currently aged from 25 to 55. A childhood immigrant is an immigrant who was under age 15 upon arrival in the US. A childhood immigrant typically did not choose to immigrate but just follow the parents’ decision. Under our definition, a childhood immigrant spent at least 11 years and at most 55 years in the US. The minimum and maximum age of observations ensure enough years are given to expose to the English environment, at the same time avoid selection biases due to retired and deceased immigrants. \n",
    "\n",
    "We further subset the data by their origins’ English tie. A childhood immigrant who has a non-English-speaking country of birth belongs to the treatment group. A childhood immigrant whose countries of birth have English as 1) an official language and 2) predominant language, belongs to the control group\n",

    "### 4.1 Cultural connotations in language\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As the authors remark in the paper, controlling the effect of mastering English (language effect) cannot exclude the effect of “melting” into the US culture and institution. The authors’ solution is to incorporate immigrants from the English speaking countries as the control group, so as to control for the non-language effect. They explain their decision:\n",
    "\n",
    ">*This is because, upon arrival in the United States, immigrants originating from English-speaking countries encounter everything that immigrants from non-English-speaking countries encounter except a new language. Thus, any difference in outcome between young and old arrivers from non-English-speaking countries that is over and above the difference from English-speaking countries can plausibly be attributed to language*. (Bleakley & Chin, 2010, p.169-170).\n",
    "\n",
    "Singling out the language effect on immigrants from non-anglophone countries certainly has a significant methodological merit, as anglophone immigrants barely come across any enormous language barrier. But it seems to us doubtful whether the authors can really separate the language effect and the culture effect.  Anglophone countries do not share the 100% same culture, however close they are.to each other. It is fairly possible that a British immigrant found the US metric system, jumbo-size Coca-Cola cups, and restaurant tipping manner very confusing. There can still be an influence of culture in the estimation of the parameters for the late-comers in treatment group. \n",
    "\n",
    "We differ our understanding of the meaning of the parameters estimated from the authors’. Instead of claiming that the difference in outcome is completely attributed to language, we can defend our thesis better by arguing that we have to take into account the embedded cultural effect in language, by looking at the nature of language. As Morris (1949) pointed out, a (natural) language is composed of three parts: semantics, syntax and pragmatics; Semantics refers to “the relations of signs to the objects to which the signs are applicable” are; Syntax refers to “the formal relation of signs to one another”; Pragmatics is “the relations of signs to interpreters”. The authors’ mistake, as it appears to us, is to assume language skill level has only the syntaxial aspect. While anglophone immigrants have not many obstacles in the syntax of English in America, they might have problems in the pragmatics of American English. For example, when a British says “Ooh, isn’t it cold?”, what he is doing (with his words) is to invite the listener to a conversation , but an American will just encode it as merely a question about weather.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2. Relationship between language, culture and pragmatics\n",
    "<img src=\"Graph/Venn diagram.jpg\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As it is shown by Wittgenstein (1967), “the speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a life-form”. Language is a social practice. When language users are interacting, the culture of the linguistic community is manifested. Culture is embedded in a language, through the pragmatics of it. Culture is instantiated in the language uses and culture-free language is not usable and empty. The language community, having their own culture, decide the rule of the “language game”, by which they determine who is a good speaker and who is not. In other words, to be a good language user, one has to know the culture of that linguistic community. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our estimation, we could not separate the cultures in the pragmatics side of English in America. But a comprehensive understanding of languages implies that we do not have to so do. Rather, it accepts the cultural aspect being part of the estimator of language level. And it includes the understanding of culture when interpreting the estimation of parameters. \n"

    "### 4.2 Social outcome and social assimilation\n",
    "It seems to us that the authors are treating “social outcome” and “social assimilation” as a pair of synonymies when they are analyzing the statistics result. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is not clear whether the variables measure the wellness of the integration. For example, why an immigrant having a child in the destination country implies that he or she better fitted into US society? Or why an immigrant and his or her spouse are both implies a higher level of social assimilation? We do not see any clear and strong intuition indicating the linkage between the proposed measures and our target concepts. Certainly, for some measures, a significantly low level indicates a potential integration problem. But we cannot tell if there is no problem by an increase in the level. \n",
    "\n",
    "A thought experiment can elaborate our point. Suppose there is a group of immigrant K from a specific country. If the mean wage of K-people (when fixing other variables) is very low, then it might indicate that they on margins in the labor market. But what if the mean-wage of K-people is very high? It would also mean that they process some systematic properties that the locals do not. These properties also differentiate K-people systematically from the locals. The high mean wage does not make them more integrated into the destination society, although they are absolutely better off in terms of living standards. \n",
    "\n",
    "An initial guess to solve the problem is to compare the difference of the mean of these variables between the immigrants and the US. If the deviation is small, then it means an immigrant is on average not having a higher or lower outcome from the locals. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is not a solution neither. This issue is more complicated by the US liberal tradition. In principle, individuals are free to choose their own form of life.  What does it mean if the immigrants are losing their “homeland features”? If k-people, after observing the undesirable outcome of keeping their “homeland features”, decide to abandon those. And they finally have an outcome having no difference in those outcomes than the locals. Are they really integrating in the US society in terms of the outcome? Or they are just integrating into the US on the surface, but they are not embracing the liberal spirit of the US, which more fundamental than those measure outcomes? To settle this debate, we have to go deep into a philosophical discussion of politics and culture. But that will not be our focus in this short article. We will just be cautious about the conceptual insufficiency of the result about certain outcomes.  \n"
